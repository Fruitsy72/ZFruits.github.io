I served as an undergraduate research assistant at the University of Oklahoma for CIWRO. Due to my research there I am now a published Coauthor for a paper titled Lightning and Radar Characteristics of Tornadic Mesocyclones of Landfalling Tropical Cyclones. My senior year I conducted research at Flogistix where I ran a global atmospheric model to track methane concentration across the United States. I was accepted to Texas A&M University for graduate school in my senior year. The summer of my first year I went to Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for an internship where I used the box model to study ice nucleating particle growth. The second year of graduate school I began my research. I rewrote the coding language it was in and changed the area of research to the Southern Great Plains. I taught an undergraduate non-major climate and weather lab at the beginning of my third year. I have recently defended my thesis which was titled 'The Seasonality of Natural and Anthropogenic Dust and Ice Nucleating Particles Over the Southern Great Plains from Observations and Modeling.'
