I spent part of my Summer in 2023 at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Using Google Colab I wrote and modified python code to run the Box Model. This model is used to
test Ice Nucleating Particle Growth. I used an immersion freezing process during these experiments. The different INPs I studied were: 
Fungal Spores, Kaolinite, Leonardite, Iron(3) Oxide, Nannochloris Atomus, Thalassiosira Pseudonana, Illite, Aluminum (3) Oxide, 1-Nonadecanol, Pahokee Peat.

I studied the temperatures they froze at using a cumulative spectra, I also compared the amount of INP's at certain temperatures with what was measured with a PINE-c dataset
from the 2022 AGINSGP Campaign.
