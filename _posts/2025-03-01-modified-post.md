During the second semester of my Junior Year at the University of Oklahoma I was accepted to be an undergraduate research assistant. I began my research with the Cooperative
Institute for Severe Weather Research and Observations (CIWRO). I tracked pre-tornadic storms using NOAA's Weather and Climate Toolkit to view previous radar scans. I
would use a dataset of all tornadic weather across the United States and track the storm before it produced the tornado. I then uploaded this data onto an excel spreadsheet.
The NOAA publication I am attached to was part of my work as well. We looked at pre-tornadic data for landfalling tropical cyclones. The paper went over the lightning
and radar characteristics of tornadic cells in landfalling tropical cyclones.
