My Senior Year at the University of Oklahoma I was an intern at Flogistix. They are an Oil and Gas company located in Oklahoma City, OK and their main objective is to
reduce the amount of emissions into the atmopshere through product optimization and emissions management.

I took outputs from the WRF model and with python code tracked the movement of methane across the United States. I tracked the concentrations on a very local scale around
mulitple well sites. I also tracked it on a broad scale across the entire United States. I however, was not able to stay for long because I was going into Graduate School.
Because of this I wrote a 13 page document following all of my steps so that the next intern would be able to get up to speed with the research quickly.
