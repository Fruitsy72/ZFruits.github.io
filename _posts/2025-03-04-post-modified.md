During my time at Texas A&M I used a dust tagging technique noted by Shi et al. (2022) and (2023). I chose my area of research as the Southern Great Plains.
Specifically I tracked anthropogenic dust concentrations around the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement site E13. I used a global climate model known as E3SMv1.
I wrote python code so that I could track the location of emission sites for both anthropogenic and natural dust. I also tracked the global concentration of dust
so that I could monitor the path of dust outside of the United States. I currently have used two dust parameterizations to calculate the amount of INPs at
the SGP E13 site. The Niemand et al. (2012) parameterization and the Demott et al. (2015) parameterization.
